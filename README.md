# Analysis of Gold, Oil, and Global Equity Markets

## Introduction

This project focuses on the relationships among three key assets: gold, oil, and the global equity markets, particularly the MSCI World Index. By examining the dynamics between these assets, we aim to understand how they interact, especially in periods of economic volatility, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

## Data & Methodology

- **Data Source**: Daily closing prices of gold, oil, and the MSCI World Index from January 2013 to December 2024.
- **Methodological Approach**:
  - **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**: To capture the interdependencies between the assets over time.
  - **Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH)**: To analyze the volatility patterns and risk co-movement among these assets.

## Results

- **Pre-COVID Analysis**: Discovered weak causal relationships among gold, oil, and equity markets, indicating limited predictive power.
- **Post-COVID Insights**: Noted significant shifts; gold emerged as a leading indicator for oil, contrasting with prior trends. The asset interactions revealed a stronger risk co-movement influenced by macroeconomic factors.
